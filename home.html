        <p class="u-text u-text-2">This was a group project where we had to find a random startup and create a series of mockups or designs for an interface they might use based off of a short blurb that gives us context about what the startup does. After going through initial sketches, we created a wireframe, adapted it into a low-fi prototype, received feedback from each other and then created a high fi prototype which went through another round of feedback and changes. The following is a walk-through the steps of iterative design.</p>

            <p class="u-text u-text-2">StatsHelix creates software for game publishers and esports tournament organizers. Our range of software products aim at improving the gaming experience across a variety of platforms for developers, esports organizations and gamers. Enhancing the gaming experience comes through a variety of ways including:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- Viewer Demographics on Streaming<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- In-Game Streaming Toolbars<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- In-Game Tips for viewers (e.g. Abilities the current champion holds)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- In-Game Statistics (e.g. real time win rate, gold counts, etc)<br>
              <br>The interface we'll be designing is a website which allows our customer base an easy browsing experience through our products depending on their needs, whether it be larg scale or individual use. Our interface would impact game publishers, esports tournament organizers, streamers and commentaters because this is our target audience and we're optimizing the shopping experience for these users.

                  <br>- Unusually large buttons<br>- Replacing some placeholder images for more context<br>- Top toolbar show where we are more clearly<br>- Good intuitive hierarchical layout<br>- Have a constant shopping cart button because we're e-commerce<br>

We then presented two scenarios where they would have to purchase an item under the pretense they were either a developer or an esports organizer. We then asked for feedback in between each step which gave us insight for the summary at the end. After they were done navigating, we had an end survey with 4 questions about their experience. The questions and answers are as follows:<br>1. What frustrated you most about this website?<br>2. If you had a magic wand, how would you improve this website?<br>3. What did you like most about this website?<br>4. How likely would you be to recommend this site to a friend?

        <p class="u-text u-text-2">The tasks we gave were relatively simple navigational tasks that focused on testing how our website prototypes logical and hierarchical structure had been implemented. Considering the feedback and small polls we conducted after each task, we determined that our site had been organized effectively and efficiently. All 3 of the users we tested had an easy time navigating the site and found that our core structure made sense and was intuitive to operate. Our subtasks included navigating to each page individually and then two scenarios based on which target customer you might be and navigating the site so as to purchase a product designed for your use case. In the case of two users, we did find that one of the errors made was dragging the site around instead of clicking through it, but they still understood how the pages connected to each other and were able to carry out the tasks we asked of them. In terms of potential interface changes, the main feedback we got was about visual aesthetics and that’s the area we could improve on the most. Our site was described as looking amateur and being too simple, so for the future we would add more flair and color to the design.<br>
